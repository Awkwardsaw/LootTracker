LootTracker
===========

Loot Tracker is a runescape tool to track your loot and exp gained while killing monsters.

future(full?) versions will include reflection to track exactly what loot you get/ exp gained/ monster killed, and possibly update the log automaticly

Instructions:
  If a monster has not already been saved, simply fill out the Monster name, HP(leave as 0 if you don't know / don't care), name of item dropped, and the amount.
  If a monster has been saved, select it from the drop down menu and hit the "Load Monster" button, which will load all stats and items previously dropped

bugs:
  If switching from a monster that has already been killed, to a new monster not on the list, the stats from the previous monster will save over to the new one. To keep this from happening(for now) close the script, and start over filling in the new monster
