LootTracker
===========

Loot Tracker is a runescape tool to track your loot and exp gained while killing monsters.

next update will include a GUI for adding data, future(full?) versions will include reflection to track exactly what loot you get/ exp gained/ monster killed, and possibly update the log automaticly

So far it saves/ loads data from an .ini file, and can add loot/ lootamount to the data. You have to do this manually for now
