LootTracker
===========

Loot Tracker is a runescape tool to track your loot and exp gained while killing monsters.

Next update will have a nice GUI, allowing the user to see all the stats for a specific monster.

future(full?) versions will include reflection to track exactly what loot you get/ exp gained/ monster killed, and possibly update the log automaticly

So far you can use the form to save and load data to the .ini file. Clicking on the 'Load Monster' button will load all previously logged monsters, if you want to add a new monster simply type in the name in a blank slot, as well as the hp.

Selecting the monster name in the drop down menu will fill in the hp slot.

So far, all the stats are displayed in the debug message window
